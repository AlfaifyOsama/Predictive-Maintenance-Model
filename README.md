# Predictive-Maintenance-Model
Here is the Medium blog post I have written: https://medium.com/@osamalfaify/predictive-maintenance-problem-d472ee59ba68

## 1. The problem

A manufacturer ask for help with a predictive maintenance problem they are having. Every year the manufacturer has a planned shutdown, where they can replace machinery parts in their industrial process. Most of the time a pump can last two years, but in a small number of cases the pump fails earlier than this. They are worried about such a failure, because if the pump fails in operation they have to shut the whole process down - something which is costly. However replacing or fixing a pump that is actually fine, and can last a year longer is also expensive. They log some process data about failure of pumps after their first year, i.e. after the shutdown. They also record the type of failure. The customer of this project wants to predict whether the pumps will fail after their first year or not.
## 2. Libraries

I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot

## 3. The repository files:
- Dataset File: the dataset that I used in this project
- Jupyter Notebook: to explore the dataset
